<h1>Compilation</h1>

<p>Compilation and interpretation of Playspecs follows the general pattern of the Thompson/Pike VM, quite clearly
    described by <a href="https://swtch.com/~rsc/regexp/regexp2.html">Russ Cox</a>. Briefly, the parse tree is compiled
    into virtual machine instructions which are then <a href="interpreter.html">interpreted</a>. In this document, we
    will start by addressing the basics of compilation, then show how custom predicates are incorporated. Finally we
    explore the addition of advanced features like subgroup matching and intersection.</p>

<p>The VM is primarily a thread scheduler, where a thread is something like a single NFA state; for now, imagine that
    each thread is defined simply by a program counter. Alternations and repetition spawn new threads (if equivalent
    threads do not yet exist), and all threads are advanced in lockstep. Threads are synchronized on
    <code class="bytecode">check Phi</code> instructions; other instructions roughly correspond to null transitions and
    are executed as far as possible until reaching <code class="bytecode">check</code> or
    <code class="bytecode">match</code> instructions. The result is that the number of trips through the thread queue is
    bounded by the length of the play trace being matched.</p>

<p>We start with "simple Playspecs", i.e. we ignore intersection for now. The core instructions are
    <code class="bytecode">check Phi</code> (where <code class="bytecode">Phi</code> is a propositional formula),
    <code class="bytecode">jump Target</code> (where <code class="bytecode">Target</code> is an integer describing the
    unconditional jump destination), <code class="bytecode">split Left Right</code> (where both arguments are integers
    describing program counter values), and <code class="bytecode">match</code> which indicates a thread has
    successfully matched. The compilation strategy is detailed in the table below.</p>

<h1>Interpretation</h1>

<p>For the purposes of this document, we'll introduce another domain for Playspecs: a hypothetical game whose moves are
    all represented by single upper- and lowercase letters. Reasonable questions to ask about states of this game
    include whether a particular letter describes the state or whether the letter is uppercase. In practice, if a
    game's traces can be defined so simply then conventional string regular expressions should serve the role of
    Playspecs quite well! But we will work from this simple case for now so that the semantics of the interpreter are
    easier to explain without bringing in too many details from a "real" game.</p>

<p>If a <code>copyCurrentState</code> function is provided by the <code>trace</code> API, it will be called on states
    before preserving them when <code>true</code> is passed to <code>match</code>. It has the same interface as
    <code>currentState</code> but is expected to return an object that will not change if <code>advanceState</code> is
    called. This can be important if the game state is a mutable data structure, so it is not necessary in the letters
    domain. Even without <code>copyCurrentState</code>, it is strongly advised to isolate traces from one another, so
    that multiple Playspecs can safely be checked concurrently.</p>

<h2>Simple Playspecs</h2>

<p>The rough outline of the interpreter follows Russ Cox's version of the Pike VM. First, a single thread is created and
    added to the thread queue. This addition may trigger the spawning of more threads, since flow control and match
    detection are handled by the <code>enqueueThread</code> function (called <code>addThread</code> in Cox's articles).
    An outer loop advances the string (in our case, the game trace) until it reaches the end, a match is found, or there
    are no live threads. The inner loop goes through each thread in the queue&mdash;each of which is by construction
    "stuck" at a <code class="bytecode">check</code> instruction&mdash;and verifies that the current state satisfies its
    condition. If not, the thread is terminated; otherwise the thread's program counter is advanced and the thread is
    re-queued (again, possibly creating more threads). During queueing, if any thread enters a
    <code class="bytecode">match</code> instruction, it is recorded in the match set and not returned to the queue.</p>

<p>The <code>enqueueThread</code> function is not allowed to duplicate threads: duplicates are always of lower
    priority than the duplicated thread, since threads are advanced in priority order. For Cox's requirements, it
    suffices to discard duplicates (since he only wants to know whether there is any match, and in a pinch its beginning
    and end). For Playspecs, we actually want to return all matches so we must merge rather than discard the duplicate
    threads. This distinction will become important when we consider subgroup matching later on. Keeping all matches
    (and using additional thread state, which we need to do for Playspec intersection) leads to some overhead,
    especially for duplicate detection<sup><a href="#footnote-1" id="ref-1">1</a></sup>. The upshot is that we separate
    the queue of scheduled processes from the set of processes which exist in that queue, since we want to avoid linear
    scans over the queue when doing duplicate checking.</p>

<p>Some more words on priority: like Cox's implementation, the right side of a split is scheduled at a lower priority
    than the left side. No other instruction (except our <code class="bytecode">fork</code>, to be introduced later)
    increases the number of threads. Matches are returned in priority order to give correct greedy vs reluctant
    semantics: in short, to mirror the order in which a backtracking implementation would return matches. It may happen,
    especially with greedy repetition, that a shorter match could complete on a given state of the trace while a longer,
    better match is not yet complete. We still want to yield that shorter match, but we would prefer to give the longer
    one first.</p>

<p>To achieve this, we also store a priority queue of matches. The priority of a match is the same as the first thread
    which obtained it (which will also be the lowest-priority thread which obtained it). If the interpreter is about to
    advance to the next state, but the best match has a lower priority than the best thread in the queue, the match is
    instead de-queued and yielded. In some cases, the interpreter could yield several matches in a row before advancing
    the state any further; this state can be detected by the <code>hasReadyMatch()</code> method of
    <code>PlayspecResult</code> objects.</p>

<p>We do want to prevent duplicate matches, so within a single advance of the trace we track which matches have been
    seen and only enqueue the first one. Matches which cover different ranges of the trace by definition will not be
    equivalent, so we don't need to track all matches found by the Playspec&mdash;just the ones found this time
    around.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
    <div>
        <p><a id="footnote-1" href="#ref-1">1.</a> Cox gives each program instruction the string index at
            which it was last activated, indicating instantly whether another thread is currently parked at that
            instruction. This effectively double-purposes the program as the set of current threads, but this approach
            grows in complexity as more thread state is introduced (e.g. for intersection, existential or universal
            quantification, possibly for lookaround, and so on). More importantly, we need to track the actual
            pre-existing threads in order to merge threads, and providing instructions with pointers (or, as thread
            equivalence becomes more complex, collections of pointers) to threads opens up issues of garbage collection,
            et cetera in the JavaScript implementation. Finally, for Playspec intersection we need to track additional
            sets of active threads to get the fork/join semantics we desire. Since we are already committing to
            implementing external sets of threads, we may as well use the same code for the live thread set, for
            simplicity. Unfortunately, we also can't avoid creating a thread duplicating one we've already seen on the current trace state: because the merge might merge data that comes from steps subsequent to the duplicate detection, we can only do duplicate checking and merging of "stuck" threads.</p>
    </div>
</div>


<h2>Some enhancements</h2>

<p>Adding new features to this Playspecs implementation mainly involves devising new parse tokens and gadgets, sometimes
    requiring new VM instructions and new thread state (in some cases, extending the notions of thread equivalence and
    thread merging). We now show two substantial enhancements, intersection and subgroup matching. These two features
    interact in significant ways that strongly influence their design, so some decisions made in pursuit of intersection
    may seem a little strange at first&mdash;but they seem to be necessary for efficiently combining both intersection
    and subgroup matching.</p>

<h3>Intersection</h3>

<p>In an explicitly automata-based regular expression engine, an intersection operator could be obtained by
    calculating NFA representations of the two operands, determinizing those, and intersecting them. This could lead
    to a blowup in the size of the resulting automaton. For our purposes, and because we want to stay in the virtual
    machine framework, we introduce a kind of fork/join semantics which is extremely constrained: for certain threads we
    have a different acceptance condition besides reaching a <code class="bytecode">match</code> instruction, and this
    corresponds to the "both sides finish at the same time" semantics we give to intersection. Complications include the
    fact that intersections can be arbitrarily sequenced and nested, and that we want to keep all subgroup matches
    occurring before <em>and within each branch</em> of the intersection.</p>

<p>Consequently, we're forced to maintain for each thread a stack of the intersections in which it's embedded, where
    each intersection is recorded as a fork index (the <em>k</em>th fork instruction has index <em>k</em>) and the
    starting index in the trace (recall that both sides of an intersection must consume the same amount of trace). Only
    traces with the same stack entries may be joined (in case they match at the same time) or merged (in case they
    duplicate equivalent traces <em>on the same side of the intersection</em>). To find joined pairs without scanning
    the whole instruction queue, we keep a separate join-set which is keyed on both stack data (so traces corresponding
    to different intersections or starting at different positions can't be joined) and left/right side (so e.g. two
    left-operands of an intersection that match simultaneously can't join together, but can be easily merged). As an
    optimization, we also keep a liveness-set which records if a thread is live on one side or the other of an
    intersection with a given fork key. If only one side of a given fork key has active threads then it is terminated
    (since the other side has no threads, it was not possible to match it, so any more effort spent matching the first
    side is wasted).</p>

<h3>Subgroup Matching</h3>
