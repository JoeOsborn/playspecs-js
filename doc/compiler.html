<h1>Compilation</h1>

<p>Compilation and interpretation of Playspecs follows the general pattern of the Thompson/Pike VM, quite clearly
    described by <a href="https://swtch.com/~rsc/regexp/regexp2.html">Russ Cox</a>. Briefly, the parse tree is compiled
    into virtual machine instructions which are then <a href="interpreter.html">interpreted</a>. In this document, we
    will address only the basics of compilation</p>

<p>The VM is primarily a thread scheduler, where a thread is something like a single NFA state; for now, imagine that
    each thread is defined simply by a program counter. Alternations and repetition spawn new threads (if equivalent
    threads do not yet exist), and all threads are advanced in lockstep. Threads are synchronized on
    <code class="bytecode">check Phi</code> instructions; other instructions roughly correspond to null transitions and
    are executed as far as possible until reaching <code class="bytecode">check</code> or
    <code class="bytecode">match</code> instructions. The result is that the number of trips through the thread queue is
    bounded by the length of the play trace being matched.</p>

<p>We start with "simple Playspecs", i.e. we ignore intersection for now. The core instructions are
    <code class="bytecode">check Phi</code> (where <code class="bytecode">Phi</code> is a propositional formula),
    <code class="bytecode">jump Target</code> (where <code class="bytecode">Target</code> is an integer describing the
    unconditional jump destination), <code class="bytecode">split Left Right</code> (where both arguments are integers
    describing program counter values), and <code class="bytecode">match</code> which indicates a thread has
    successfully matched. There are also the group capturing commands <code class="bytecode">start</code> and
    <code class="bytecode">end</code> and the intersection operator <code>^</code>, but we leave off discussion of those
    until we extend Playspecs with <a href="interpreter.html#subgroups">subgroup capture</a> and
    <a href="#intersection">intersection</a> respectively. The compilation strategy is detailed in the table below.</p>

<h1>Compilation via Finite Automata</h1>

<p>The approach above directly follows Cox, implicitly defining an automaton and immediately compiling it to bytecodes.
    This automaton is somewhat like a control flow graph, where nodes indicate operations like checking a predicate
    against the current trace state or splitting to explore multiple options. While this technique is efficient and
    easy to explain, there are two issues of expressiveness: first, subgroup capture and greedy versus non-greedy
    matching are grafted in during the compilation step but have no automata-theoretic representation; and second,
    because we never have an explicit automaton, we cannot use automata intersection to handle Playspec intersection
    (we would need to extend the virtual machine with extra thread data and bookkeeping). The second case is much
    more problematic, so it's worth trading some compiler complexity for a simpler interpreter.</p>

<p>This section covers four algorithms at varying levels of abstraction, and with many references to conventional
    techniques for generating NFAs from regular expressions or to standard algorithms over SFAs. The source code in
    <code>compiler.js</code> and <code>sfa.js</code> is the best reference, and I have tried to hew as close as
    possible to a schematic implementation (and to the discussion below).</p>

<p>To keep the efficiency benefits of the straightforward approach described earlier, we only create explicit automata
    when trying to compile an intersection in the course of compiling a Playspec (future work should compare the
    time and space usage of the two techniques and perhaps commit only to the SFA approach if it is by some chance
    superior). Roughly, the Playspecs on each side of the intersection are separately transformed into symbolic finite
    automata, these are intersected using the technique described by
    <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/133121/MSR-TR-2010-90.pdf">Hooimeijer and Veanes</a>. The resulting
    automaton is finally compiled to the same bytecodes described above, though using a different code generator.
    Because arbitrary Playspecs may appear inside of intersections, the transformation to finite automata must handle
    the whole Playspecs language (including, of course, nested intersections, which are handled as just described except
    that code is not immediately generated). These automata have ordered edges to account for greedy vs reluctant
    matches, and edge labels include both game-specific predicates and capture group beginnings and endings. Note that
    all the edges below except the one in the very first example are &#949;-transitions.</p>

<p>In the examples above, every formula has its own <code>in</code> and <code>out</code> nodes. In practice, the state
    machine is grown outwards from the start node with each bit of Playspec syntax adding edges and new nodes. In other
    words, compiling a single piece of Playspec syntax to an automaton uses an existing state as <code>in</code> and
    emits edges pointing towards an <code>out</code> which is provided by the external caller; this will be used as the
    next piece of syntax's <code>in</code>. Once the whole Playspec has been compiled in this way, the final set of
    <code>out</code> edges are pointed to a fresh terminal state (i.e. a jump to the terminal
    <code class="bytecode">match</code> instruction in VM terms). This is all done to keep the state machine small and
    minimize the number of intermediate states and transitions.</p>

<p>Except for intersections, all of a Playspec's accepting paths will lead into a single accepting state via
    &#949;-transitions. A Playspec which preferentially accepts over trying to match more of the trace (or vice versa)
    expresses this priority via the ordering of edges. Unfortunately, algorithms for intersecting two symbolic finite
    automata require the elimination of &#949;-transitions. This risks losing the vital ordering information as well as
    the edge labels that terminate capture groups, so we must adapt &#949;-elimination and SFA intersection in three
    ways.</p>

<p>First, every accepting state gets an &#949;-transition to itself. We call this an "accepting self
    &#949;-transition," which means simply an &#949;-transition from an accepting state to itself, which would otherwise
    be redundant. During &#949;-elimination, these transitions are not removed, but propagated to each state which can
    reach an accepting state via &#949;-transitions. Since edges of more remote states are propagated backwards through
    edges of closer states, this effectively maintains a depth-first ordering of edges including the accepting self
    &#949;-transitions. As edges are propagated backwards, their labels are prepended with the label of the edge by
    which they were reached. In this way, every state does a depth-first traversal along &#949;-transitions to pull back
    the edges of the &#949;-closure of states in the correct order.</p>

<p>Second, the conventional algorithm for intersection must be modified to recognize this special kind of
    &#949;-transition. The main change here is, when iterating over the edges of a state A from the left automaton and a
    state B from the right automaton, to skip the main body of the loop when only one or the other edge is an accepting
    self &#949;-transition; if both are such a transition, then add an accepting self &#949;-transition to the
    originating state and mark it as terminal. As for the labels, the labels of the edge of A are prepended to the
    labels of the edge of B, and the resulting list is the label for the new edge. The edge ordering falls out of the
    sequence in which edges are processed (iterating over those of A on the outside and those of B on the inside).
    Whereas the usual algorithm for intersection requires theory-specific intersection of edge formulae, we must rely on
    the game in question to tell us whether the formulae conflict or, if not, what their intersection is. In the absence
    of this information we will create spurious transitions and potentially spurious states.</p>

<p>Third, the SFA resulting from intersection has its accepting self &#949;-transitions replaced with
    &#949;-transitions to a fresh accepting state (keeping the same labels, effectively just changing the target of
    these intersections). This means that the SFA returned from the intersection algorithm has &#949;-transitions only
    to a single accepting state, and the accepting self &#949;-transitions are gone.</p>

<p>Finally, once we have an automaton in hand we can compile it to bytecodes. This follows the rough outline of the
    usual bytecode generation, except that instead of processing a syntax tree we must process a graph of states
    connected by edges. The recursive algorithm maintains a dictionary mapping visited states to jump targets as well as
    a set of the jump-past-end-of-machine instructions which are generated from &#949;-transitions to the terminal state
    of the machine (note that these are not necessarily terminal states of the overarching Playspec into which this
    machine is being planted). Since we know a priori that the SFA in question came from an SFA intersection operation,
    we know that the only &#949;-transitions are to a single accepting node (if this were not known, we could always
    perform &#949;-elimination and re-point the accepting self &#949;-transitions to make it so).</p>

<p>The algorithm recurses in a depth-first fashion, avoiding cycles. Nodes with no transitions should never appear
    (except for the single accepting node). Nodes with one transition are compiled along their single transition. Nodes
    with more than one transition are compiled first with a split, then the result of compiling their first edge; then,
    if the node has more than two transitions, another split and then the result of compiling the second edge
    (otherwise, just the result of compiling the second edge); and so on.</p>

<p>Compiling an edge has three cases. In all three, first the bytecodes corresponding to the edge's label and formula
    are inserted. The first case is when the edge points to the terminal accepting state; here, a jump to an unknown
    target is appended and the jump is added to the set of jump-past-end-of-machine instructions. Second, if the edge
    points to an already-visited state, a jump to that state's known start location is added. Finally, if the target
    state is not yet visited, its code is generated immediately after the edge's label and formula bytecodes.</p>
