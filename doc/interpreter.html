<h1>Interpretation</h1>

<p>In this document, we will show an end-to-end use of Playspecs. We introduce a new "game" whose states are letters,
    showing how custom predicates are incorporated as atomic formulae. Then we explain the virtual machine approach to
    Playspec checking, following <a href="https://swtch.com/~rsc/regexp/regexp2.html">Russ Cox</a>. Finally, we explore
    the addition of subgroup matching to the basic interpreter.</p>

<p>For the purposes of this document, we'll introduce another domain for Playspecs: a hypothetical game whose moves are
    all represented by single upper- and lowercase letters. Reasonable questions to ask about states of this game
    include whether a particular letter describes the state or whether the letter is uppercase. In practice, if a
    game's traces can be defined so simply then conventional string regular expressions should serve the role of
    Playspecs quite well! But we will work from this simple case for now so that the semantics of the interpreter are
    easier to explain without bringing in too many details from a "real" game.</p>

<p>If a <code>copyCurrentState</code> function is provided by the <code>trace</code> API, it will be called on states
    before preserving them when <code>true</code> is passed to <code>match</code>. It has the same interface as
    <code>currentState</code> but is expected to return an object that will not change if <code>advanceState</code> is
    called. This can be important if the game state is a mutable data structure, so it is not necessary in the letters
    domain. Even without <code>copyCurrentState</code>, it is strongly advised to isolate traces from one another, so
    that multiple Playspecs can safely be checked concurrently.</p>

<h2>Simple Playspecs</h2>

<p>The rough outline of the interpreter follows Russ Cox's version of the Pike VM. First, a single thread is created and
    added to the thread queue. This addition may trigger the spawning of more threads, since flow control and match
    detection are handled by the <code>enqueueThread</code> function (called <code>addThread</code> in Cox's articles).
    An outer loop advances the string (in our case, the game trace) until it reaches the end, a match is found, or there
    are no live threads. The inner loop goes through each thread in the queue&mdash;each of which is by construction
    "stuck" at a <code class="bytecode">check</code> instruction&mdash;and verifies that the current state satisfies its
    condition. If not, the thread is terminated; otherwise the thread's program counter is advanced and the thread is
    re-queued (again, possibly creating more threads). During queueing, if any thread enters a
    <code class="bytecode">match</code> instruction, it is recorded in the match set and not returned to the queue.</p>

<p>The <code>enqueueThread</code> function is not allowed to duplicate threads: duplicates are always of lower
    priority than the duplicated thread, since threads are advanced in priority order. For Cox's requirements, it
    suffices to discard duplicates (since he only wants to know whether there is any match, and in a pinch its beginning
    and end). For Playspecs, we actually want to return all matches so we must merge rather than discard the duplicate
    threads. This distinction will become important when we consider subgroup capture later on. Keeping all matches
    could lead to some overhead, but this is mitigated since we do not consider the captures when determining whether
    one thread is a duplicate of another<sup><a href="#footnote-1" id="ref-1">1</a></sup>. The upshot is that we
    separate the queue of scheduled processes from the set of processes which exist in that queue, since we want to
    avoid linear scans over the queue when doing duplicate checking.</p>

<p>Some more words on priority: like Cox's implementation, the right side of a split is scheduled at a lower priority
    than the left side. No other instruction (except our <code class="bytecode">fork</code>, to be introduced later)
    increases the number of threads. Matches are returned in priority order to give correct greedy vs reluctant
    semantics: in short, to mirror the order in which a backtracking implementation would return matches. It may happen,
    especially with greedy repetition, that a shorter match could complete on a given state of the trace while a longer,
    better match is not yet complete. We still want to yield that shorter match, but we would prefer to give the longer
    one first.</p>

<p>To achieve this, we also store a priority queue of matches. The priority of a match is the same as the first thread
    which obtained it (which will also be the lowest-priority thread which obtained it), and ties between matches are
    broken by preferring the <em>later</em> match (to accommodate greedy semantics). If the interpreter is about to
    advance to the next state, but the best match has a lower priority than the best thread in the queue, the match is
    instead de-queued and yielded. In some cases, the interpreter could yield several matches in a row before advancing
    the state any further; this state can be detected by the <code>hasReadyMatch()</code> method of
    <code>PlayspecResult</code> objects.</p>

<p>We do want to prevent duplicate matches, so within a single advance of the trace we track which matches have been
    seen and only enqueue the first one. Matches which cover different ranges of the overall trace by definition will
    not be equivalent, so we don't need to track all matches found by the Playspec&mdash;just the ones found this time
    around.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
    <div>
        <p><a id="footnote-1" href="#ref-1">1.</a> Cox gives each program instruction the string index at
            which it was last activated, indicating instantly whether another thread is currently parked at that
            instruction. This effectively double-purposes the program as the set of current threads, but this approach
            grows in complexity as more thread state is introduced (e.g. for existential or universal
            quantification, possibly for lookaround, and so on). More importantly, we need to track the actual
            pre-existing threads in order to merge threads, and providing instructions with pointers to threads (or, as
            thread equivalence becomes more complex, collections of pointers) opens up issues of garbage collection and
            the like in the JavaScript implementation. Unfortunately, this means we can't avoid creating a thread
            duplicating one we've already seen on the current trace state; we can merely avoid scheduling it. This is
            because the merging of two threads might combine data that comes from interpretation steps subsequent to the
            duplicate detection, so we can only do duplicate checking and merging of "stuck" threads.</p>
    </div>
</div>


<h2 id="subgroups">Subgroup Capture</h2>

<p>The interpreter described so far only has enough information about the match to yield its ending position, not its
    starting one&mdash;recall that every match is anchored to the first character! In fact, it implicitly uses the
    subgroup capture extension to provide the whole match, as if the whole Playspec were wrapped in a capture. We use an
    explicit syntax for capturing groups, where each group may have an optional identifier (consisting of letters,
    numbers, and underscores and must start with a letter or an underscore). In effect, each Playspec <code>p</code> is
    interpreted as <code>$root(p)</code>. Captures may be nested arbitrarily, but may not appear inside of propositional
    terms.</p>

<p>Our use of captures differs somewhat from conventional regular expression libraries. The biggest difference is that
    captures which are enclosed within repetitions appear in the resulting match object multiple times. For the intended
    use case of describing game play traces, this seemed like the best decision. A match result is therefore a list of
    captures, with the root capture first and subsequent captures following. Each capture is tagged with its identifier
    and its index.</p>

<p>At compilation time, a capture group turns into a pair of <code class="bytecode">start Group</code> and
    <code class="bytecode">end Group</code> instructions, with the group body in between. During interpretation, each
    thread tracks the contents of the capture groups it has seen. These two instructions cause their executing threads
    to begin and end the named captures. Because playtrace states may be transient (they may come from on-demand
    simulation rather than from a pre-calculated list), if the sequence-preserving option is given to <code>match</code>
    then each <code class="bytecode">check</code> instruction also stores a reference to the current state with the
    executing thread whenever it has an active capture (whenever it is between a start and an end instruction). These
    three commands&mdash;starting, continuing, and stopping a capture&mdash;form a simple instruction set which is
    robust to the splitting and merging of threads.</p>

<p>When two threads are merged, one may have a different set of sequences of matches than the other. We want to
    preserve them both so we take the union of both sets, updating the priority of each match to be no less than the
    better thread's priority. Note that this means one thread may be responsible for several matches with different
    priority levels! Correspondingly, when splitting a thread, the split side gets a copy of the original thread's match
    set, updating the priority of these matches in the same way. All of this copying could probably be avoided using
    some extra bookkeeping data or with immutable data structures.</p>

<p>When a thread finally matches, the match sequences in its match set are all added to the interpreter's match queue in
    priority order. When a match is popped from the queue as described above, its sequence of
    <code class="bytecode">start</code>, <code class="bytecode">state</code>, and <code class="bytecode">end</code>
    instructions is evaluated to produce a sequence of capture objects with the following properties:</p>

<dl>
    <dt>group</dt>
    <dd>The supplied or generated capture group identifier.</dd>
    <dt>groupIndex</dt>
    <dd>The index of this capture group. Groups are numbered left-to-right.</dd>
    <dt>start</dt>
    <dd>The beginning time-point of this capture with respect to the start of the play trace.</dd>
    <dt>end</dt>
    <dd>The end time-point of this capture with respect to the start of the play trace.</dd>
    <dt>states</dt>
    <dd>If states are included, the list of states comprising this capture.</dd>
</dl>

<p>All these captures (except for the first implicit root capture) are collected in the order in which they started and
    stored in the <code>subgroups</code> field of the match result. Empty captures are dropped.</p>
